SliTaz Installer
================================================================================


The first SliTaz installer use ncurses Dialog within a SHell script. At the
date of april 2011 is is the last SliTaz home make tools who dont have a
desktop integrated interface. So we must think different and make change,
we must also keep in mind that the first installer have some crappy code
since it was written at the start of the project.

The NEW way to think: one installer, all in SHell script and usable from the
cmdline without dialog or any other gui alike interface! This new installer
must be able to perform an installation automatically based an a simple config
file wich clear variables such as: TYPE="iso|web", TARGET="/dev/hda1", USER="".

This way we will be able to create different kind of frontend: Dialog, GTK and
CGI/web in TazPanel. The front just have to create a config file and start
the cmdline installer and report steps in a nice way (progess bar or/and
messages).
