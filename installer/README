SliTaz Installer
================================================================================


The first SliTaz installer uses ncurses Dialog within a SHell script. As of
April 2011 it is the last SliTaz home made tool which doesn't have a
desktop integrated interface. So we must think differently and make changes,
we must also keep in mind that the first installer had some crappy code
since it was written at the start of the project.

The NEW way to think: one installer, entirely in SHell script and usable from 
the cmdline without dialog or any other gui-like interface! This new installer
must be able to perform an installation automatically based an a simple config
file with clear variables such as: TYPE="iso|web", TARGET="/dev/hda1", USER="".

With this way, we will be able to create a different kind of frontend: Dialog, 
GTK and CGI/web in TazPanel. The frontend just has to create a config file and 
start the cmdline installer and report steps in a nice way (progess bar or/and
messages).
