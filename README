The SliTaz tools package provide many tinyutils, shared and custom configuration
files destined to improve SliTaz. The tools was initialy created to help people
build there own distribution by followin SliTaz Cookbook, now the package mostly

tazctrlbox, the installer, etc.

The package also provide some scripts (firewall), desktop files with there icons,
the licenses and examples to help hackers or users understand and manage SliTaz.


Installation
------------
The tools are are build and installed throught tazwokthe wok and splitted
into 2 separated packages, one with only ncurses dependencie (for text system)
and one with GTK has dependancie (for grahical system). So make install...

Translation
-----------	
To start a new translation please use msginit from the pot file directory.
Example for French/France locale (fr_FR):

	$ msginit -l fr_FR -o fr.po -i subox.pot

To update all pot files when some new strings have been added (mainly for
developers before commit):

	$ make pot

To update all translations from the pot file:

	$ make msgmerge

To compile po files for testing purposes you can use 'make msgfmt' or manually 
compile your translation. Example for french locale, note that the file must be 
copied into /usr/share/locale/fr/LC_MESSAGES so gettext can find it:

	$ msgfmt -o tazusb.mo fr.po
