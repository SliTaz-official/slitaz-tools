The SliTaz tools package provides many tinyutils, shared and custom 
configuration files destined to improve SliTaz. The tools were initially 
created to help people build their own distribution by following the SliTaz 
Cookbook; now the package mostly provides all the configuration tools and 
all home-made GTK boxes such as subox, tazctrlbox, the installer, etc.

The package also provide some scripts (firewall), desktop files with their 
icons, the licenses and examples to help hackers or users understand and 
manage SliTaz.


Installation
------------
The tools are built and installed through tazwok and the wok, and split
into 2 separate packages: one with only ncurses dependencies (for a text 
system) and one with GTK dependencies (for a graphical system). So make 
install...

Translation
-----------	
To start a new translation please use msginit from the pot file directory.
Example for French/France locale (fr_FR):

	$ msginit -l fr_FR -o fr.po -i tazbox.pot

To update all pot files when some new strings have been added (mainly for
developers before commit):

	$ make pot

To update all translations from the pot file:

	$ make msgmerge

To compile po files for testing purposes you can use 'make msgfmt' or manually 
compile your translation. Example for french locale, note that the file must 
be copied into /usr/share/locale/fr/LC_MESSAGES so gettext can find it:

	$ msgfmt -o tazbox.mo fr.po
