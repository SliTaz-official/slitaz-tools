SliTaz tools                                                               2011
===============================================================================


The SliTaz tools package provides many tinyutils, and shared and custom 
configuration files designed to improve SliTaz. The tools were initially 
created to help people build their own distribution by following the SliTaz 
Cookbook; now the package mostly provides all the configuration tools and 
all home-made GTK boxes such as subox, tazctrlbox, the installer, etc.

The package also provides some scripts (firewall), desktop files with their 
icons, and the licenses and examples to help hackers or users understand and 
manage SliTaz.


More tools information
-----------------------
You will find documentation in the doc/ folder and README files for some tools:

    * installer/README
    * tazbox/README
    * tazdrop/README


Installation
------------
The tools are split into 2 separate packages: one with only ncurses dependencies
(for a text system) and one with GTK dependencies (for a graphical system). So
we have to make install and make default to compile PO files. Install's support
DESTDIR for packaging:

# make
# make install
# make install-boxes


Translation
-----------	
To start a new translation please use msginit from the pot file directory.
Example for French/France locale (fr_FR):

	$ msginit -l fr_FR -o fr.po -i tazbox.pot

To update all pot files when some new strings have been added (mainly for
developers before commit):

	$ make pot

To update all translations from the pot file:

	$ make msgmerge

To compile po files for testing purposes you can use 'make msgfmt' or manually 
compile your translation. Example for french locale, note that the file must 
be copied into /usr/share/locale/fr/LC_MESSAGES so gettext can find it:

	$ msgfmt -o tazbox.mo fr.po
