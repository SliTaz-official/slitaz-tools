Tazx is the configuration tool to manage your X window 
sessions on a SliTaz box. Simply select a value and press 
OK. You can also select a (Xorg) session by selecting a 
video driver best suited to your hardware. After you first 
run 'startx', the configuration is saved in the executable 
files ~/.xsession and ~/.xinitrc. These files are then used 
to start a X session with 'startx' or via the Slim login 
manager. Note that these files can be edited with a 
text editor.
