Welcome to SliTaz GNU/Linux post installation setup. To offer
the best experience with the distribution you will be asked
for basic system settings.

SliTaz Config will let you set system keymap, the root password,
then add a new user and finally it will configure all packages
(it may take a while depending on the installed packages set)

SliTaz-config can be run when ever you want from the cmdline.
