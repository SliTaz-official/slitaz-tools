SliTaz Drag N' Drop tool
================================================================================


TazDrop is a small window which can run in a corner of a screen and as an 
expanded panel and let you Drag N' Drop any kind of content and perform an 
action on it. If you drop an URL to a site it will open a browser to its 
location, if the URL is a file (tarball, iso, PDF, etc) it will download it. 
It can also handle email addresses, SliTaz Packages (drop one on TazDrop and 
it will install it) and if you drop a folder it will create a tar.bz2 archive 
of it. You can even drop one of its options, try to drop: --notes

Note: This tool is separate from tazboxes since it runs permanently and has
quite a few lines of code.


Auto start the DND window
-------------------------
To start TazDrop with your Window manager you have to put these lines in your
autostart script (For Openbox: ~/.config/openbox/autostart.sh)

# TazDrop Drag N' Drop handler
tazdrop --dnd &


Skip task bar in Openbox
------------------------
To not show the apps in the panel (lxpanel, tint2) you must add these
settings to your Openbox rc.xml after <applications> at the bottom of
the file:

  <application name="tazdrop">
    <focus>no</focus>
    <skip_taskbar>yes</skip_taskbar>
  </application>


Misc notes
----------

	* Dropped folders will be archived to tar.bz2
	* Text content is written to $HOME/.cache/tazdrop.notes
	* Applications are logically configurable as well as the tool
	  behaviour
